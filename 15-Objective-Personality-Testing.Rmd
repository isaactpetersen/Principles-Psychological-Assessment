## Overview of Personality Tests

There are two main types of personality tests: objective personality tests and projective personality tests. Of course, no measure is truly "objective" but some measures are more or less so. In a so-called *objective personality test*, a stimulus is presented to a respondent, who makes a closed-ended (constrained) response, such as True/False or Likert ratings. Examples of objective personality tests include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). In a *projective personality test*, an ambiguous stimulus is presented to a respondent, who is asked to make an open-ended response. Examples of projective personality tests include the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Projective tests have largely fallen by the wayside now, but it is still helpful to think about their potential advantages. Projective tests are described in further detail in Chapter \@ref(projective).

### Projective Personality Tests

In a projective personality test, the client's response is not limited. Projective personality tests were designed from a psychodynamic perspective, and they are supposed to have limitless variability and therefore a freer access to the client's internal world. However, one of the Rorschach Inkblot card looks like a moth or a bat, and around 80% of respondents give that response, so projective tests are not completely limitless. Projective personality tests are designed to have ambiguous content. This is, in part, to make them hard to figure out what is being assessed. However, even so-called objective personality tests can have items that are ambiguous and that function similar to a projective test. For instance, one of the items on the original MMPI asks respondents whether they like mechanics magazines. But, many people have never looked at a mechanics magazine. So, it becomes like a Rorschach question because the client starts to think about other factors.

Scoring of projective tests does not rely on the client's insight, so projective tests might get past social desirability of clients' responses and potential defensiveness. Therefore, projective tests are potentially difficult to fake. Faking good means to present oneself as better than one actually is, whereas faking bad means to present oneself as worse than one actually is. For instance, a client may want to fake good on a test if it allows them to keep custody of their child. By contrast, a client may want to fake bad to receive disability insurance.

As of 1995, the TAT and Rorschach were the #5 and #6 most widely used assessments, respectively, by clinical psychologists [@Watkins1995]. However, they and other projective techniques have lost considerable ground since then.

### Objective Personality Tests

In contrast to projective personality tests, objective personality tests, the client's responses are substantially constrained to the possible answers. Moreover, objective personality tests tend to be cheap and fast to administer, and can be scored by computers now. In addition, objective tests have more reliable scoring than projective tests. It is very long to score the Rorschach Inkblot Test and it it still has very low reliability. With an objective test, by contrast, scoring reliability approaches perfection. The earliest examples of objective personality tests were teh MMPI and the Strong Vocational Interest Blank. The MMPI assesses personality, whereas the Strong Vocational Interest Blank assessed preferences for different jobs or professions.

## Example of an Objective Personality Test: MMPI

The MMPI is an example of a so-called "objective" personality test. But, the MMPI and other objective personality tests are not truly objective. Consider an example of a True/False item from the MMPI: "I hardly ever notice my heart pounding and I am seldom short of breath." The item is intended to assess somatic symptom disorder, with a response of "false" being more indicative of disorder. But, there are other factors that could influence a person's response to the question besides whether the person has somatic symptom disorder. Figure \@ref(fig:somaticSymptom) depicts how a person's response to the question could be influenced by several factors. A comorbidity of somatic symptom disorder could make it more likely that a person answers with a response of "false", in line with somatic symptom disorder. In addition, a person's insight ability may influence whether they answer with a response of "false." Also, people who exercise more may experience a pounding heart and shortness of breath more frequently (i.e., while exercising), and therefore answer with a response of "false." In sum, the item and the test as a whole is clearly not "objective" because constructs in the questions are not clearly defined. What does a "pounding heart" mean? How much is "hardly ever"? People may define "seldom" differently.

```{r somaticSymptom, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Depiction of some of the factors that could influence a respondent's answer to the True/False question: 'I hardly ever notice my heart pounding, and I am seldom short of breath.'.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Images/somaticSymptom.png")
```

There are multiple forms of measurement error for a given item. For instance, there are situational sources of measurement error. Consider the item "I hardly ever notice my heart pounding, and I am seldom short of breath." For example, how many stairs the participant climbed to get to the lab could influence their response to the question. Other situational factors could include whether they are dehydrated, whether they have a cold or are sick, and what they did over the past week. Another form of measurement error could result from the purpose of test taking. It is important to consider the purpose of the assessment. For example, if the assessment is for disability payments or to get a physical job, such as a firefighter, it may change a person's answers. [Response biases](methodBias), such as social desirability, could also influence a person's answers. In addition, memory limitations of the person could influence their responses.

## Problems with Objective True/False Measures

There are a number of problems with objective True/False measures. However, the problems are not necessarily unique to objective personality measures or to True/False measures.

One problem is related to the [response biases](methodBias) of acquiescence and disacquiescence. *Acquiescence* occurs when the person agrees in response to items regardless of item content. Acquiescence occurs oftentimes when the participant is just going along because they think the experimenter may want them to have certain characteristics, therefore they often just say "TRUE" a lot. That is, they may want to please the investigators. *Disacquiescence*, by contrast, is when the person disagrees in response to the items regardless of item content. Disacquiescence is also called opposition bias. Disacquiescence may occur if the person does not think they have the disorder or problem of the characteristics being explored.

True/False measures, just like other questionnaire formats, are influenced by multiple sources of variation. In an objective personality test, there is a high demand on respondents. For instance, on the MMPI, respondents must be aware of recall over an unspecified period of time, which can cause confusion. The high demand on respondents can lead to inaccuracy of individuals' reading of the items. Additional sources of information could influence the respondents answers to the item "I hardly ever notice my heart pounding, and I am seldom short of breath." Some respondents may be intoxicated while answering questions, which could influence physiological experiences. Some respondents may have comorbordities that influence their responses. Psychological and medical comorbidities could cause difficulty in interpreting the questions. For example, the respondent may wonder whether the investigator is inquiring about heart beating that reflects anxiety versus heart beating that reflects high blood pressure.

In addition, there are effort differences that influence people's responding. There has been a recent resurgence in how to measure respondents' effort. There are often limits to predicting phenomena due to individuals not putting effort into answering questions. Other potential sources of variation in an item could include psychopathology, stress, physical fitness, age, and gender. For instance, older people are more likely to notice shortness of breath because their lung capacity is less than what it used to be. Moreover, women more likely to say "FALSE" to this item than men, but the item has less social desirability bias than some other items, so women could be putting in more effort and giving different responses than men.

In sum, lots of factors beyond the construct of interest can influence a response on an item. It is valuable to scan through your measures and consider what goes into a person's answers. It is important to keep the content in mind of all things contributing to scores, and you should consider these potential factors when interpreting results!

Another problem with some questions are compound questions, also called double-barreled question. Double-barreled questions following the structure: $\text{T/F: X} + \text{Y}$. An example of a compound question is, "True or False: Cars should be faster and safer." It is unclear which components of a compound question people are responding to. In conclusion, every objective test is partly projective—that is, the stimuli are interpreted in different ways by different people.

## Approaches to Developing Personality Measures

There are three primary approaches to developing personality measures:

1. An external approach, also called an empirical approach or criterion-keyed approach
2. A deductive approach, also called a rational, theoretical, or intuitive approach
3. An inductive approach, also called an internal or item-metric approach

However, these approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be combined.

### External Approach

The external approach to developing a personality measure is also called the empirical approach or the criterion-keyed approach. The external approach relies on an external criterion. In general, a criterion-keyed approach examines scores on items in relation to the criterion, and selects items that are associated with the criterion, regardless of the item content. The MMPI is an example of a scale that was developed using the external approach. For the MMPI, the criterion was a group (i.e., a criterion group approach), or more accurately, multiple groups: patients with different disorders and controls. The original MMPI was not developed based on theory (e.g., theoretical understanding of the construct of depression); instead, it was developed based on its empirical associations with a criterion group. Because an external approach relies on an external criterion, if people lost interest in the scale criterion, the scale loses interest.

Consider the development of the MMPI as an example. The developers grouped people together based on their criterion status, for example one group of schizophrenics and a control group that does not have mental disorders. How did they get the test? The idea of the external approach is to let nature decide what goes into the test. So, the MMPI developers sampled thousands of questions very broadly from pre-existing questionnaires of personality, symptoms, etc. Then, they had the criterion (e.g., schizophrenia) and control groups answer the questions. They examined the item responses to determine which items discriminate between groups (i.e., which items are associated with criterion group status). And if an item(s) is good at discriminating between the criterion and control groups, the items are selected for the measure. It was purely empirical business—i.e., dustbowl empiricism. In sum, using an external approach, item selection depends on the discriminatory power of each item to inform about an external criterion of interest. Such an approach does not require having any theoretical assumptions about item functioning.

#### Pros

There are several pros of using the external approach to develop measures:

- You do not need to know anything—it requires no theory or theoretical knowledge about disorders and their etiology
— There is likely to be some generalizability of the utility of the measure in the future because there is some carryover of criterion-related validity
— The measure has some practical utility given its relation to criteria of interest
— "Subtle items" with poor face validity can be selected solely based on their discriminatory power. Subtle items are items that neither you nor the respondent predicted would show differences between groups. Subtle items provide an advantage that the data are moving beyond our ignorance. It is also an advantage that clients cannot fake subtle items as well as they can more obvious items.

#### Cons

There are also cons of using the external approach to develop measures:

- Measures developed using the external approach have lower content and/or face validity because they include subtle items. For exmaple, the original version of the MMPI had low content and face validity. Using the external approach, it is possible to construct a scale that makes no sense due to lack of consideration of face validity.
- The success of the external approach depends highly on the quality of the criterion and control groups—if a criterion falls out of favor as an indicator of the construct (or interest fades) then the utility of the test decreases because it is no longer applicable.
- Items will not always generalize because the generalizability depends on the representativeness of the sample and the quality of the groups—if you select poor groups, it is not a representative sample, which results in a biased measure. The validity of the scale depends on the representativeness of your groups in regard to the criterion of interest. It is possible that your findings might not be generalizable if your sample is not—this is especially problematic when you rely only on data and not on theory.
    - An example of the importance of the representativeness of the sample comes from the original MMPI. The norms of the original MMPI were based on largely White participants from Scandinavian, German, and Irish Descent in the Midwestern U.S., with an average of an 8th grade education. The norms became known as "Minnesota farmers." Therefore, "Minnesota normals" (i.e., the control group) were pretty "dull" normals. In addition, to be included in the norms, the respondents for the MMPI had to be waiting in the hospital (not everyone does that for family in the hospital) and had to be kind enough to take a 4–5 hour measure for psychologists (not all would do this). For all of these reasons, there were issues with poor generalizability of the original MMPI norms in the broader population. A scale is most likely to be valid when it is used with similar populations and in similar conditions.
- Shrinkage often occurs when using a measure developed using an external approach. As described in Section \@ref(modelAccuracy), *shrinkage* is when variables with stronger predictive power in the original data set tend to show somewhat smaller predictive power (smaller validity coefficients) when applied to new groups. When variables are selected empirically, they tend to show less predictive power (smaller validity coefficients) when applied to new groups during cross-validation. Shrinkage reflects a model over-fitting, because it is somewhat capitalizing on chance in selecting items. Many subtle items may be instances of Type I error (false positives). Shrinkage is especially likely when the original sample is small and/or unrepresentative and the number of variables considered for inclusion is large
- Externally developed measures also have a problem of communicability [@Burisch1984]. For something to have meaning to others, it should have connection to constructs, which may not be true for many measures developed using the external approach.
- It can take a long time to develop measures using the external approach, and they tend to be longer to administer because of having more items. For instance, there are 567 items in the MMPI-2.

#### MMPI Examples

Paul Meehl wrote his dissertation to develop the K scale of the MMPI to attempt to detect faking good. Faking good is reporting in a way to present as better than one actually is. In the context of the MMPI, it would involve under-reporting of symptoms. He developed the K scale based on all positive qualities that around half of people typically endorse. So, it is not obvious that the items reflect faking good, and if someone is trying to respond in a socially desirable way, they endorse more of these positive qualities. There is also a "faking bad" version of the scale, too. "Faking bad" (F) scale was developed as an attempt to detect malingering (over-reporting of symptoms).

However, the MMPI could pathologize normality in some cases. Some psychotic patients may have been identified as "faking bad" because they actually have had a lot of odd experiences. And very healthy people may have gotten higher score on "faking good," but they just may be very positive and well-adjusted. As examples from the original MMPI from 1940, male teenagers tended to have elevated scores on the psychopathy and mania scales. Graduate students, including female graduate students, tended to have higher "masculine" scores on the Mascuilinity/Femininity (Mf) scale. This shows that non-clinical samples can still have "clinical" scores. In the 1930s–1940s, there was an emphasis on developing empirically based measures, where the researchers rely on data, not theory as previously emphasized.

### Deductive Approach

The deductive approach to developing a personality measure is also called a rational, theoretical, or intuitive approach. Using a *deductive approach*, the choice and definition of constructs precede and govern the formulation of items. Item pools are generated using theoretical considerations, and item selection depends on possessing a rich theoretical knowledge about the construct and selecting which items assess the construct the best. In a deductive approach, the measure developer deduces the content; they do not rely on criterion data to select the content. Deducing the content involves thinking and talking about the construct, and having experts write items that they think would do well in eliciting information about the construct. The measure developer deduces from the construct which items to use. Therefore, the deductive approach completely depends on our ability to understand a given construct and translate this understanding to the generation of item content that will be understood by the examinees in such a way that it elicits accurate ratings for the construct of interest. Most assessments are developed using the deductive approach.

#### Pros

There are several pros of using the deductive approach to develop measures:

- Using the deductive approach is fast, easy, and short. Generating such scales requires few people, and is often fast and accurate. It does not typically take as much time to develop a measure using the deductive approach. Moreover, it allows the possibility of short scales that are quick to administer. By contrast to short scales developed by the deductive approach, the MMPI (developed using the external approach) is very long.
- Measures developed (well) using the deductive approach are always content valid because of the reliance on theory—items tend to be prototypical of the construct.
- Measures developed using the deductive approach are usually face valid, more likely than external approach. Face validity is often an advantage, but not always. for disseminabilty and adoption by others, .
- Tends to have better communicability (how comprehensible the information communicated is to the examiner based on the responses)


#### Cons

There are also cons of using the deductive approach to develop measures:

### Inductive Approach

The inductive approach to developing a personality measure is also called

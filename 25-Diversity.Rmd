# Cultural and Individual Diversity {#diversity}

Like [ethics](#ethics), considerations of cultural and individual diversity are relevant to all of our domains as psychologists, including (but not limited to) research, teaching, assessment, intervention, and supervision. As a result, I have discussed important considerations about diversity throughout the book. At the same time, given the importance of cultural and individual diversity, I also provide this section, which is devoted more fully to these issues within the assessment context.

## Terminology

### DEI

#### Diversity {#diversity}

*Diversity* refers to all aspects of differences between people. Thus, diversity applies to groups, not an individual. There are many aspects of human difference, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, creed, color, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, language, culture, national origin, religion/spirituality, age, (dis)ability, military/veteran status, personality, political perspective, and associational preferences.

Having a diverse group (e.g., of participants, clients, patients, etc.) is insufficient. It is also important to make sure that we take steps for all groups to feel included ([inclusion](#inclusion)) and to thrive ([equity](#equity)).

#### Equity {#equity}

*Equity* refers to [fair](#fairness) and just practices and policies that ensure everyone can thrive. Equity is different from equality. *Equality* involves treating everyone equally (i.e., treating everyone the same). However, due to structural inequities—historic and current (e.g., structural racism)—some people are disadvantaged and marginalized more so than others. Structural racism refers to "the normalization and legitimization of an array of dynamics—historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal—that routinely advantage non-Latinx White persons while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for Black and other people with minoritized identities in housing, education, employment, health care, criminal justice, and psychology." [@Byrd2021, p. 279]. Treating people equally (equality) does not allow everyone to thrive given these different experiences and unequal access to opportunities. Thus, equity seeks to help everyone thrive, including those are marginalized with fewer access to opportunities.

#### Inclusion {#inclusion}

*Inclusion* refers to providing a community where all members are and feel respected, have a sense of belonging, and are able to participate and achieve their potential.

### Multicultural Assessment Frameworks

A review of frameworks for multicultural assessment is provided by @Edwards2017a.

#### The ADDRESSING Model {#addressing}

The *ADDRESSING* model [@Hays2016] provides a framework to consider some of the commonly examined differences between people within a clinical context. ADDRESSING is an aconym that stands for:

- **A**ge and generational differences
- **D**evelopmental or other <br/>
  **D**isability
- **R**eligion and spiritual orientation
- **E**thnic and racial identity
- **S**ocioeconomic status
- **S**exual orientation
- **I**ndigenous heritage
- **N**ational origin
- **G**ender

These are some important aspects of differences between people that can be helpful to understand when working with a client and how they self-identify. In addition to the aspects of diversity identified in ADDRESSING, there are other aspects of diversity and difference that may be worth considering, including but not limited to personality, culture, and political beliefs.

#### DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview

The [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](#dsm) (DSM) provides a framework for clinicians to organize cultural information about a client using the Cultural Formulation Interview [@LewisFernandez2014]. The Cultural Formulation Interview is a [semi-structured interview](#semiStructuredInterview) and is available here: https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Cultural-Formulation-Interview.pdf.

#### Multicultural Assessment Procedure

The Multicultural Assessment Procedure was developed by @Ridley1998. The framework includes four phases:

1. gather clinical data, including cultural data, through history taking and multiple methods for the purpose of formulating a case conceptualization
2. interpret clinical and cultural data to formulate a hypothesis keeping in mind:
    - to differential the cultural data as being either idiosyncratic (i.e., unique to the individual client and would not necessarily be expected of other members of the client's culture) or culture-specific
    - consider [base rates](#baseRate)
    - differentiate dispositional from environmental stressors
    - differentiate clinically significant data from data that are not clinically significant
3. incorporate cultural data with other clinical information to test the hypotheses by ruling out medical explanations and using appropriate assessments and testing
4. arrive at a sound assessment decision (case conceptualization)

The procedure also includes debiasing strategies to minimize the likelihood of clinical judgment errors. @Ridley2001 expanded on this framework in consideration of [ethical issues](#ethics) in multicultural assessment.

#### Multicultural Assessment–Intervention Process

The Multicultural Assessment–Intervention Process was developed by @Dana1998. The process provides a flowchart for clinicians to conduct assessment by asking relevant questions about cultural orientation, type of assessment instrument (e.g., etic or emic), cultural formulation for diagnosis, and intervention approach (e.g., universal, culture-general, culture-specific, identity-specific, etc.). *Etic* assessments are culture-general whereas *emic* assessments are culture-specific.

## Assessments with Ethnic, Linguistic, and Culturally Diverse Populations

### Methodological and Conceptual Challenges in Research

Methodological and conceptual challenges for conducting research with ethnic minorities are described by @Okazaki1995. Guidelines for conducting research with diverse groups are described by @Burlew2019.

#### Use of Terms: Race, Ethnicity, Culture

Use of terminology with respect to race, ethnicity, and culture is a key challenge in assessment of ethnic minorities. Many people refer to race, ethnicity, and culture interchangeably. There is no definition of race, ethnicity, and culture that is universally agreed on [@Okazaki1995]. As described by @Okazaki1995, "the use of the term 'race' appears to imply biological factors, as races are typically defined by observerable physiognomic features such as skin color, hair type and color, eye color, stature, facial features, and so forth." (p. 367). By contrast, ethnicity (ethnic status) has been defined as "an easily identifiable characteristic that implies a common cultural history with others possessing the same characteristic." [@Eaton1980, p. 160]. Ethnic identifiers for evaluating whether people share a "common cultural history" include racial, national, tribal, religious, linguistic, or cultural origin or background. Thus, race and ethnicity, though conceptually distinct, are related as race can be an ethnic identifier.

Researchers have argued that race designations are arbitrary [@Helms2005], that race is a social construct rather than a biological construct [@Yudell2016], that race has no genetic basis [@Yudell2016], that within-race differences are greater than between-race differences [@Zuckerman1990], and that racial categories lack conceptual meaning [@Helms2005]. However, even though race does not appear to have a genetic or biological basis, racism is real and is a major problem [@Smedley2005]. Thus, race is still important to consider from a perspective of racialized experiences and discrimination even if the racial categories do not represent underlying biological differences.

In terms of determining what to assess and analyze, it is important for the researcher to determine whether they are interested in evaluating race as a biological variable, ethnicity as a demographic variable, or an aspect of cultural experience as a psychological variable [@Okazaki1995]. Researchers often use race and/or ethnicity as proxy variables for psychological variables such as cultural values, self-concept, minority status, etc. However, race and ethnicity are distal to the variables that may be of most psychological interest. It is thus important to assess the psychological processes of interest, rather than merely relying on racial or ethnic categories.

#### Whether to Examine Individual Differences or Group Characteristics

One question the researcher should consider is whether they are interested in understanding individual differences or group characteristics. They can both be valuable and important questions to examine. However, researchers should not under-estimate within-group heterogeneity [@Okazaki1995]. The greater the within-group heterogeneity, the less accurate predictions tend to be. Moreover, inferences at the group-level cannot necessarily be applied to the individual level; the confounding of an individual with the individual's culture leads to stereotyping [@Okazaki1995], which should be avoided.

#### Selecting Participants

One question is which groups to include in the research design and in what proportion. For group-related comparisons, the researcher would need a large enough sample size for every group examined to have adequate power to identify group-related differences. If the researcher is interested in studying a particular group, a question is whether to use a comparison group. A comparison group can provide a basis of comparison to better interpret the findings in the group of interest. However, inclusion of a comparison group can add time, cost, and as a result may lead to the ability to achieve a smaller sample in the group of interest. Moreover, the group comparison approach has been criticized for reinforcing racial stereotypes, reinforcing Whites as the standard group and non-White behavior as deviant, and overlooking within-group variation [@Okazaki1995]. Thus, decisions about which groups to include, in what proportion, and whether to include a comparison group should be guided by the questions and purpose of the study.

Another issue is how to achieve fair group comparisons. One approach is to match groups on secondary characteristics such as demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status) or other abilities (e.g., intelligence). The goal of matching is for participants to be similar as possible in the relevant characteristics apart from their group classification. However, there are challenges to matching groups on all relevant characteristics. Another approach is to control for these secondary characteristics in analysis. Which variables to include as control variables is an important question that depends on the goal. Generally, researchers recommend controlling for social and demographic characteristics such as educational attainment, income level, and language fluency, when group-related differences exist on those variables and the researcher believes that such differences may moderate the associations of interest [@Okazaki1995].

#### Group Comparisons

In addition to main effects of group status, it may also be important to consider *interaction* effects of group status, consistent with an intersectionality approach. However, power to detect interactions tends to be weaker than power to detect main effects, both because of smaller effect sizes and because of smaller sample sizes of the intersecting groups.

#### Sampling

Researchers face important questions with how to identify, sample, and recruit ethnic minority samples. Groups, such as ethnic groups, may be classified at a broad level (e.g., Latinx or Hispanic) or at a more specific level (e.g., Puerto Rican, Mexican American, etc.). Researchers must also determine how to classify people of mixed racial or ethnic backgrounds. It is also important to note that it is an incorrect assumption that once people are identified as belonging to a particular ethnic-cultural group, that they share a common understanding of their own ethnicity or culture and identify with the ethnic-cultural group [@Okazaki1995].

Given the challenges of recruiting a sizeable sample size with specific ethnic-cultural groups (e.g., Japanese Americans), researchers often combine data from multiple ethnic-cultural groups with some common origin. For instance, researchers might combine Chinese Americans, Japanese Americans, and Korean Americans into one group. Or, researchers might comibine people from multiple tribal groups among American Indians. However, broadening the ethnic grouping increases the heterogeneity of the groups, so the researcher must decide which are the sources of variability that can and cannot be overlooked [@Okazaki1995].

Provide a thorough description of the sample and sampling methodology used. For instance, it can be helpful to describe participants on additional dimensions to race and ethnicity, including generational status, acculturation, self-identification, ethnic and cultural composition of the neighborhoods or communities, etc. [@Okazaki1995].

#### Establishing Equivalence of Measures

Five key areas need to be empirically evaluated in using or adapting instruments across cultures or groups to reduce or eliminate cultural [bias](#bias) [@Hunsley2007]:

- Conceptual equivalence
- Linguistic (or translation) equivalence
- Psychological equivalence of the items
- Functional equivalence
- Metric and scalar equivalence

Conceptual equivalence refers to establishing that the construct has the same meaning across groups. Linguistic (or translation) equivalence refers to the measure have the same linguistic meaning in each language to which it has been translated. Best practices for establishing translation equivalence include having experts translate and back-translate the measure, comparing both the original and back-translated versions, and revising the translation accordingly [@Okazaki1995]. Psychological equivalence of the items deals with establishing that the psychological effect each item has in for each group or in the different versions. Functional equivalence deals with establishing similar [predictive](#predictiveValidity) and [concurrent](#concurrentValidity) [criterion-related validity](#criterionValidity) to prevent [test bias](#bias) (i.e., similar regression intercepts and slopes between measure and criterion). Metric and scalar equivalence deal with establishing that the construct is measured on the same metric across groups, that is, a particular score reflects the same level on the construct for people in each group. Metric equivalence deals with establishing that items' [discrimination](#itemDiscrimination) parameters (or factor loadings) are the same across groups, whereas scalar equivalence deals with establishing that both items' [discrimination](#itemDiscrimination) parameters (or factor loadings) and [difficulty](#itemDifficulty) parameters (or intercepts) are the same across groups.

#### Methods of Assessment

It is debatable whether some assessment methods may be more likely to result in cultural or ethnic [bias](#bias) compared to other assessment methods [@Okazaki1995]. For instance, there may be selection biases regarding the types of people who are willing to participate in in-depth studies that involve [observational](#behavioral) or [psychophysiological](#psychophysiological) assessment. It may be worth considering supplementing quantitative measurement approaches with qualitative measurement approaches, such as interviews and life histories, which may be better able to capture cultural factors. In general, it is advantageous to assess people using multiple measures and methods to establish [convergent validity](#convergentValidity) of cultural constructs [@Okazaki1995].

#### Interpretation of Data

Another challenge deals with interpreting data from group comparison designs.

### APA Guidelines

There are many disparities in psychological services for under-served populations, including health disparities, diagnostic disparities, and disparities in the use and availability of psychological services [@RiveraMindt2010]. To help address these disparities, the American Psychological Association Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs published guidelines for providers of psychological services to ethnic, linguistic, and culturally diverse populations [@APAOfficeEthnicMinorityAffairs1993]. Their guidelines included suggestions such as:

- Whenever possible, provide information in writing along with oral explanations.
- Whenever possible, provide the information and interact in the language that is understandable to the client. If that is not feasible, make an appropriate referral. If this is not possible, provide a translator with cultural knowledge and an appropriate professional background. When no translator is available, then use a trained paraprofessional from the client's culture as a translator.
- If you do not possess knowledge and training about an ethnic group, seek consultation with, and/or make referrals to, appropriate experts as necessary.
- Consider the [validity](#validity) of a given instrument or procedure and interpret resulting data, keeping in mind the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the client.
- Be aware of the test's reference population and possibility limitations of using the instrument with other populations.
- Seek to help clients determine whether a "problem" stems from racism or [bias](#bias) in others so that the client does not inappropriately personalize problems.

### Seek Training and Consultation

Research has shown that relatively few practitioners receive extensive training in multicultural assessment and few use frameworks for multicultural assessment [@Brickman2006; @Edwards2017a]. Researchers have encouraged increasing multicultural education, training, awareness, and knowledge, increasing multicultural psychological research, and increase the provision of culturally competent psychological services to ethnic minorities [@RiveraMindt2010].

### Ensure Adequate Representation of Under-Represented Groups in Research

Many groups, including Blacks, Latinx, and gender and sexual minorities have not been adequately represented in research studies. As a result, the knowledge gained from unrepresentative studies may not generalize to other under-represented groups. Science plays an important role in advancing knowledge that can lead to the development of new treatments. However, groups who are under-represented in research are less likely to benefit from the new treatments because the knowledge upon which the treatments were developed and tested may not generalize to the under-represented groups. Moreover, the lack of inclusion of under-represented groups in studies leads to inappropriate [normative data](#norm). Thus, it is crucial to have better representation of historically marginalized and minoritized groups in science, including Blacks, Latinx, and gender and sexual minorities.

### Do Not Use Offensive Content or Procedures

It is important to avoid using content or procedures that are culturally or racially insensitive, or that are racist, sexist, heteronormative, and/or ableist [@Byrd2021]. When developing assessments, it may be important to evaluate stimuli in focus groups to ensure they are not offensive.

One of the most widely used standardized assessments in psychological assessment is the Boston Naming Test, a measure of visual confrontation naming that is used to assess cognitive impairment, aphasia, and dementia. The Boston Naming Test includes a noose as one of the items. Historically, lynchings with a noose were used in the United States as a form of racial terror against Blacks. Thus, the use of a noose as an item in the Boston Naming Test is racially insensitive and inappropriate for use because it is deeply offensive and has a harmful nature. It can have a strong negative impact on Black respondents in terms of distress, performance, and health disparities [@Byrd2021].

Culturally offensive stimuli can lead to stereotype threat and compromise the [validity](#validity) of the assessment. Stereotype threat occurs when people are or feel at risk of conforming themselves to stereotypes about their social group, thus leading them to show poorer performance in ways that are consistent with the stereotype. Moreover, the use of offensive procedures likely contributes to greater distrust of the scientific and medical fields among under-served communities, which acts as a barrier to health care and to health disparities. Thus, removing and replacing offensive stimuli may be necessary from a moral and [ethical](#ethics) perspective to do no harm and to assure [valid](#validity) assessment, even if it risks modifying the standardized procedure from which the [norms](#norm) were developed [@Byrd2021]. When deviating from standardized procedures, it is important to describe such deviations in resulting papers or reports. 

### Examine and Correct for Test Bias

As described in Chapter \@ref(bias), there are two types of [test bias](#bias): [predictive test bias](#predictiveBias) and [test structure bias](#testStructureBias). It is important to evaluate the possibility of both when using assessments across groups.

It is important to establish [measurement invariance](#measurementInvariance) across groups to ensure that scores have the same meaning for each group [@Burlew2019]. If measures are non-invariant, the means (i.e., level) and or associations between constructs could appear to (artifactually) differ across groups, when in reality they do not [@Chen2008]. [Measurement invariance](#measurementInvariance) can be examined in terms of item intercepts, item factor loadings, and item residuals. Establishing measurement invariance of just intercepts or factor loadings (or vice versa) is not sufficient to establish measurement invariance because tests can show strong [bias](#bias) in one dimension (e.g., intercepts) even if the test does not show bias in other dimensions (e.g., factor loadings)  [@Wicherts2010]. Approaches for evaluating [measurement invariance](#measurementInvariance) across groups are described by @Han2019. To help minimize the potential for [test bias](#bias), reseachers are encouraged to develop the scales simultaneously across the different groups or cultures [@Fernandez2018].

It is also important to determine whether the measure's scores shows similar relations to meaningful external criteria [@Burlew2019].

@Fernandez2018 provide strategies to address cross-cultural bias, such as excluding words or concepts that are specific to one language or culture. Use of North American neuropsychological tests in other countries has shown to lead to considerable [false positives](#falsePositive), and that the extent of misdiagnosis differed by country [@Daugherty2017].

### Use Appropriate Normative Data

When group-referenced judgments will be used, it is important to consider what the appropriate [norm](#norm) is. The question of whether separate [norms](#norm) should be used for various racial/ethnic minority groups is of considerable controversy [@Burlew2019]. Pros and cons of using group-specific [norms](#norm) are discussed in Section \@ref(withinGroupNorming) and reviewed by @Manly2005. The question about which [norms](#norm) to use are complex, and psychologists should evaluate the cost and benefit of each [norm](#norm), and use the [norm](#norm) with the greatest benefit and the least cost for the client [@Manly2007]. @Burlew2019 recommend limiting the use of measures that require the use of [norms](#norm) to interpret, and to note in the limitations of a paper or report if a [norm](#norm) based on one group is used to evaluate a person from a different group.

### Contextualize Group-Related Differences

When conducting research and identifying different scores between groups, it is important to be cautious not to automatically ascribe differences in the scores between groups to the group status. For instance, if the researcher identifies higher rates of suicide in transgender than cisgender individuals [as has been observed, @Toomey2018], it is important not to automatically assume the higher suicide rate is *because of* the person's transgender status, per se. Rather, there are likely many aspects of discrimination and victimization that transgender individuals experience that unfortunately increases their suicide rate relative to cisgender individuals.

It is important to contextualize test score differences between groups within sociocultural and historical inequities rather than interpreting group-related differences in tests scores from a deficit-based narrative [@Byrd2021]. It is important to avoid interpretive [bias](#bias) and to pay attention not to over- or under-pathologize [@Okazaki1995]. For instance, one should be aware of the danger of under-estimating psychopathology for clients from different cultures (from that of the therapist) through over-attributing bizarre behavior or thought patters to the client's culture [@Okazaki1995].

### Use Person-First Language

When writing reports, manuscripts, or in conversation, it can be helpful to use person-first language. The aim of people-first language is to reduce stigma because it treats everyone as a human first. People-first language puts the person before the disability and describes the difficulties a person has rather than who a person is. For instance, say "a child with intellectual disability" instead of "an intellectually disabled child."

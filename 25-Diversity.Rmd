# Cultural and Individual Diversity {#diversity}

Like [ethics](#ethics), considerations of cultural and individual diversity are relevant to all of our domains as psychologists, including (but not limited to) research, teaching, assessment, intervention, and supervision. As a result, I have discussed important considerations about diversity throughout the book. At the same time, given the importance of cultural and individual diversity, I also provide this section, which is devoted more fully to these issues within the assessment context.

## Terminology

### DEI

#### Diversity

*Diversity* refers to all aspects of differences between people. Thus, diversity applies to groups, not an individual. There are many aspects of human difference, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, creed, color, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, language, culture, national origin, religion/spirituality, age, (dis)ability, military/veteran status, personality, political perspective, and associational preferences.

#### Equity

*Equity* refers to [fair](#fairness) and just practices and policies that ensure everyone can thrive. Equity is different from equality. *Equality* involves treating everyone equally (i.e., treating everyone the same). However, due to structural inequities—historic and current (e.g., structural racism)—some people are disadvantaged and marginalized more so than others. Structural racism refers to "the normalization and legitimization of an array of dynamics—historical, cultural, institutional, and interpersonal—that routinely advantage non-Latinx White persons while producing cumulative and chronic adverse outcomes for Black and other people with minoritized identities in housing, education, employment, health care, criminal justice, and psychology." [@Byrd2021, p. 279]. Treating people equally (equality) does not allow everyone to thrive given these different experiences and unequal access to opportunities. Thus, equity seeks to help everyone thrive, including those are marginalized with fewer access to opportunities.

#### Inclusion

*Inclusion* refers to providing a community where all members are and feel respected, have a sense of belonging, and are able to participate and achieve their potential.

There are many ways we can promote a more inclusive environment for examinees. One way is to use person-first language. People first language puts the person before the disability and describes the difficulties a person has rather than who a person is. For instance, say "a child with intellectual disability" instead of "an intellectually disabled child".

Another way to promote a more inclusive environment is to avoid using culturally or racially insensitive stimuli or racist stimuli. For instance, one of the most widely used standardized assessments in psychological assessment is the Boston Naming Test, which includes a noose as one of the items. Historically, lynchings with a noose were used in the United States as a form of racial terror against Blacks. Thus, the use of a noose as an item in the Boston Naming Test is racially insensitive and inappropriate for use. It can have a strong negative impact on Black respondents in terms of distress, performance, and health disparities [@Byrd2021].

### Multicultural Assessment Frameworks

A review of frameworks for multicultural assessment is provided by @Edwards2017a.

#### The ADDRESSING Model {#addressing}

The *ADDRESSING* model [@Hays2016] provides a framework to consider some of the commonly examined differences between people within a clinical context. ADDRESSING is an aconym that stands for:

- **A**ge and generational differences
- **D**evelopmental or other <br/>
  **D**isability
- **R**eligion and spiritual orientation
- **E**thnic and racial identity
- **S**ocioeconomic status
- **S**exual orientation
- **I**ndigenous heritage
- **N**ational origin
- **G**ender

These are some important aspects of differences between people that can be helpful to understand when working with a client and how they self-identify. In addition to the aspects of diversity identified in ADDRESSING, there are other aspects of diversity and difference that may be worth considering, including but not limited to personality, culture, and political beliefs.

#### DSM-5 Cultural Formulation Interview

The [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](#dsm) (DSM) provides a framework for clinicians to organize cultural information about a client using the Cultural Formulation Interview [@LewisFernandez2014]. The Cultural Formulation Interview is a [semi-structured interview](#semiStructuredInterview) and is available here: https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM5_Cultural-Formulation-Interview.pdf.

#### Multicultural Assessment Procedure

The Multicultural Assessment Procedure was developed by @Ridley1998. The framework includes four phases:

1. gather cultural data through history taking and multiple methods
2. interpret cultural data to formulate a hypothesis keeping in mind:
    - to differential the cultural data as being either idiosyncratic (i.e., unique to the individual client and would not necessarily be expected of other members of the client's culture) or culture-specific
    - consider [base rates](#baseRate)
    - differentiate dispositional from environmental stressors
    - differentiate clinically significant data from data that are not clinically significant
3. incorporate cultural data with other clinical information to test the hypotheses by ruling out medical explanations and using appropriate assessments and testing
4. arrive at a sound assessment decision

The procedure also includes debiasing strategies to minimize the likelihood of clinical judgment errors.

#### Multicultural Assessment–Intervention Process

The Multicultural Assessment–Intervention Process was developed by @Dana1998. The process provides a flowchart for clinicians to conduct assessment by asking relevant questions about cultural orientation, type of assessment instrument (e.g., etic or emic), cultural formulation for diagnosis, and intervention approach (e.g., universal, culture-general, culture-specific, identity-specific, etc.). *Etic* assessments are culture-general whereas *emic* assessments are culture-specific.

## Assessments with Ethnic, Linguistic, and Culturally Diverse Populations

There are many disparities in psychological services for under-served populations, including health disparities, diagnostic disparities, and disparities in the use and availability of psychological services [@RiveraMindt2010]. To help address these disparities, the American Psychological Association Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs published guidelines for providers of psychological services to ethnic, linguistic, and culturally diverse populations [@APAOfficeEthnicMinorityAffairs1993]. Their guidelines included suggestions such as:

- Whenever possible, provide information in writing along with oral explanations.
- Whenever possible, provide the information and interact in the language that is understandable to the client. If that is not feasible, make an appropriate referral. If this is not possible, provide a translator with cultural knowledge and an appropriate professional background. When no translator is available, then use a trained paraprofessional from the client's culture as a translator.
- If you do not possess knowledge and training about an ethnic group, seek consultation with, and/or make referrals to, appropriate experts as necessary.
- Consider the [validity](#validity) of a given instrument or procedure and interpret resulting data, keeping in mind the cultural and linguistic characteristics of the client.
- Be aware of the test's reference population and possibility limitations of using the instrument with other populations.
- Seek to help clients determine whether a "problem" stems from racism or [bias](#bias) in others so that the client does not inappropriately personalize problems.

Research has shown that relatively few practitioners receive extensive training in multicultural assessment and few use frameworks for multicultural assessment [@Brickman2006; @Edwards2017a]. Researchers have encouraged increasing multicultural education, training, awareness, and knowledge, increasing multicultural psychological research, and increase the provision of culturally competent psychological services to ethnic minorities [@RiveraMindt2010].

When conducting research and identifying different scores between groups, it is important to be cautious not to automatically ascribe differences in the scores between groups to the group status. For instance, if the researcher identifies higher rates of suicide in transgender than cisgender individuals [as has been observed, @Toomey2018], it is important not to automatically assume the higher suicide rate is *because of* the person's transgender status, per se. Rather, there are likely many aspects of discrimination and victimization that transgender individuals experience that unfortunately increases their suicide rate relative to cisgender individuals.

### Test Bias

As described in Chapter \@ref(bias), there are two types of [test bias](#bias): [predictive test bias](#predictiveBias) and [test structure bias](#testStructureBias). It is important to evaluate the possibility of both when using assessments across groups.

It is important to establish [measurement invariance](#measurementInvariance) across groups to ensure that scores have the same meaning for each group [@Burlew2019]. If measures are non-invariant, the means (i.e., level) and or associations between constructs could appear to (artifactually) differ across groups, when in reality they do not [@Chen2008]. [Measurement invariance](#measurementInvariance) can be examined in terms of item intercepts, item factor loadings, and item residuals. Establishing measurement invariance of just intercepts or factor loadings (or vice versa) is not sufficient to establish measurement invariance because tests can show strong [bias](#bias) in one dimension (e.g., intercepts) even if the test does not show bias in other dimensions (e.g., factor loadings)  [@Wicherts2010]. Approaches for evaluating [measurement invariance](#measurementInvariance) across groups are described by @Han2019. To help minimize the potential for [test bias](#bias), reseachers are encouraged to develop the scales simultaneously across the different groups or cultures [@Fernandez2018].

It is also important to determine whether the measure's scores shows similar relations to meaningful external criteria [@Burlew2019].

@Fernandez2018 provide strategies to address cross-cultural bias, such as excluding words or concepts that are specific to one language or culture. Use of North American neuropsychological tests in other countries has shown to lead to considerable [false positives](#falsePositive), and that the extent of misdiagnosis differed by country [@Daugherty2017].

### Appropriate Normative Data

When group-referenced judgments will be used, it is important to consider what the appropriate [norm](#norm) is. The question of whether separate [norms](#norm) should be used for various racial/ethnic minority groups is of considerable controversy [@Burlew2019]. Pros and cons of using group-specific [norms](#norm) are discussed in Section \@ref(withinGroupNorming) and reviewed by @Manly2005. The question about which [norms](#norm) to use are complex, and psychologists should evaluate the cost and benefit of each [norm](#norm), and use the [norm](#norm) with the greatest benefit and the least cost for the client [@Manly2007]. @Burlew2019 recommend limiting the use of measures that require the use of [norms](#norm) to interpret, and to note in the limitations of a paper or report if a [norm](#norm) based on one group is used to evaluate a person from a different group.

# Cultural and Individual Diversity {#diversity}

Like [ethics](#ethics), considerations of cultural and individual diversity are relevant to all of our domains as psychologists, including (but not limited to) research, teaching, assessment, intervention, and supervision. As a result, I have discussed important considerations about diversity throughout the book. At the same time, given the importance of cultural and individual diversity, I also provide this section, which is devoted more fully to these issues.

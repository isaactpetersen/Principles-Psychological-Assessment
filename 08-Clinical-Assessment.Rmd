# General Issues in Clinical Assessment {#clinical}

## Terminology

*Prevalence* is the proportion of the population that has the condition a given point in time, whereas *incidence* is the rate of occurrence of new cases. Incidence indicates the risk of developing or contracting the condition, whereas prevalence indicates how widespread the condition is. *Point prevalence* is the proportion of the population that has the condition at a single point in time. *Lifetime prevalence* is the proportion of the population that will ever have a condition at any point in their lifetime.

The *positivity rate* is the proportion of tests that are positive. The *case fatality rate* is the proportion of people with a condition who die as a result of that condition.

## The Three S's: Signs, Symptoms, and Syndromes

*Signs* are observable features (or manifestations) of a disorder [@Lilienfeld2015]. Therefore, signs can be perceived by a clinician. By contrast, *symptoms* are unobservable manifestations of a disorder that can only be perceived by the client [@Lilienfeld2015]. The term "sign" has a connotation of being somewhat more objective than symptom because a symptom is based on the client's perceptions, but at least in clinical psychology (and also in many medical fields), both signs and symptoms have considerable elements of subjectivity. A *syndrome* is a collection of signs and symptoms that co-occur and may reflect a particular disorder.

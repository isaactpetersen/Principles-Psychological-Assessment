# Chapter 1: Introduction

This book is about the principles of psychological assessment to help researchers and clinicians better develop, evaluate, administer, score, integrate, and interpret psychological assessments.
The assessments one uses should be supported by science.
I provide analysis scripts in the free software, `R`.
Many `R` functions in this book are available from the `petersenlab` package.

Assessment is the gathering of information to improve decision making.
Many assessment approaches can be used to assess people's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, including self-report questionnaires, questionnaires reported by others, interviews, observations, biopsychological assessments, performance-based assessments, archival approaches, and combinations of these.
However, there has been a proliferation of pseudoscience in assessment, including harmful and inaccurate assessments, an ethical problem.
It is important to understand the characteristics of science that distinguish it from pseudoscience.

Many domains of science have struggled with a replication crisis—many findings fail to replicate.
Much of the current discussion in psychology surrounding the replication crisis deals with questionable research practices.
However, the field has paid insufficient attention to how lousy/noisy measures might contribute to the replication crisis.
It is crucial to use assessments with strong psychometric properties, including reliability and validity, and to develop better assessments.

# Chapter 2: Scores and Scales

It is important to consider the types of data your data are. 
There are four general data types: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
Nominal data are distinct categories.
Ordinal data are ordered categories: they have a name and an order.
Interval data are ordered and have meaningful distances (i.e., equal spacing between intervals).
Ratio data are ordered, have meaningful distances, and have a true (absolute) zero that represents absence of the construct.
The types of data restrict what options are available to analyze the data.
Many analyses approaches assume data that are interval or ratio.

It is also important to consider whether the data were transformed because score transformations are not neutral—they can impact the results.
Norm-referenced scores, such as percentile ranks, standardized scores, *T* scores, *z* scores, scaled scores, standard scores, scaled scores, and stanine scores are scores that are referenced to some norm or standard of comparison.

# Chapter 3: Constructs

It is important to think about the nature of a construct before deciding how to estimate it.
For a formative construct, the indicators influence the construct, and a linear composite such as a weighted mean or sum score is justifiable.
For a reflective construct, the construct influences the indicators, and it is more appropriate to estimate it with a reflective latent variable that reflects the common variance among the indicators using structural equation modeling, factor analysis, or item response theory.

Causal indicators may not be correlated whereas effect indicators must be correlated.
Suggestions to sample all facets of a construct when determining indicators is necessary only for causal indicators.
For effect indicators of a unidimensional construct, equally reliable measures are interchangeable.
For effect indicators, high correlations are desirable.
For causal indicators, too high of a correlation between indicators is likely to introduce the problem of multicollinearity, so lower correlations are optimal.

# Chapter 4: Reliability

Reliability is how much repeatability, consistency, and precision a measure's scores have.
There are multiple aspects of reliability, and the extent to which a given aspect of reliability is important depends on the construct of interest.
Measures should show strong inter-rater, intra-rater, immediate parallel-forms, and internal consistency reliability.
However, the extent to which our measures should show test–retest and delayed parallel-forms reliability depends on the stability of the construct and the time lag.
Moreover, although measures should show strong internal consistency reliability, the internal consistency reliability of a measure can be too high, and for some constructs (i.e., formative constructs), internal consistency would not be expected.

Reliability is not a characteristic that resides in a test.
The reliability of a measure's scores reflects an interaction of the properties of the test with the population for whom it is designed and the sample, situation, and context in which it is administered.
Thus, it is important to adequately describe the aspects of reliability that have been considered and the population, sample, and context in which the measure is assessed.

# Chapter 5: Validity

Validity is how much accuracy, utility, and meaningfulness the interpretation of a measure's scores have for a particular purpose.
There are multiple aspects of validity.
Validity is not a characteristic that resides in a test.
The validity of a measure's scores reflect an interaction of the properties of the test with the population for whom it is designed and the sample and context in which it is administered.
Thus, when reporting validity in papers, it is important to adequately describe the aspects of validity that have been considered and the population, sample, and context in which the measure is assessed.

There are many types of measurement validity, but the central psychometric aspect of measurement validity is construct validity.
That is, whether the measure accurately assesses the target construct is the most important consideration of measurement validity.
Construct validity includes the nomological network of the construct and subsumes other key types of measurement validity, including convergent, discriminant (divergent), criterion-related, concurrent, predictive, and content validity.

A measure can be no more valid than it is reliable.

# Chapter 6: Generalizability Theory

Generalizability theory is an alternative measurement theory to classical test theory that does not treat all measurement differences across time, rater, or situation as "error" but rather as a phenomenon of interest.
G-theory examines the extent to which scores are consistent across a specific set of conditions.
G-theory can be a useful way of estimating multiple aspects of reliability and validity of measures in the same model, which classical test theory cannot achieve.
In G-theory, the true score is conceived of as a person's universe score—the mean of all observations for a person over all conditions in the universe—this allows us to estimate and recognize the magnitude of multiple influences on test performance (e.g., times, raters, items, groups, instruments).

The G-Theory equivalent of the classical test theory reliability coefficient of a measure is the generalizability coefficient or dependability coefficient.
The generalizability and dependability coefficients evaluate the extent to which variance is due to person variance rather than variance as a function of items, occasion, raters, methods, or other factors.

# Chapter 7: Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is not factor analysis.
PCA is a technique for data reduction, whereas factor analysis uses latent variables and can be used to identify the structure of measures/constructs or for data reduction.
Many people use PCA when they should use factor analysis instead, such as when they are assessing latent constructs.
Nevertheless, factor analysis has weaknesses including indeterminacy—i.e., a given data matrix can produce many different factor models, and you cannot determine which one is correct based on the data matrix alone.
There are many decisions to make in factor analysis, including, (1) what variables to include in the model and how to scale them, (2) the method of factor extraction, (3) the kind of factor analysis: exploratory (EFA) or confirmatory (CFA), (4) how many factors to retain, (5) if EFA, whether and how to rotate factors, and (6) model selection and interpretation.
These decisions can have important impacts on the resulting solution.
Thus, it can be helpful for theory and interpretability to help guide decision making when conducting factor analysis.

# Chapter 8: Structural Equation Modeling

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an advanced modeling approach that allows estimating latent variables as the common variance from multiple measures.
SEM holds promise to account for measurement error and method biases, which allows one to get more accurate estimates of constructs, people's standing on constructs (i.e., individual differences), and associations between constructs.

Path analysis is similar to multiple regression but also allows inclusion of multiple dependent variables in the same model.
SEM is path analysis but with latent variables.
A SEM model consists of a measurement model and a structural model.
The measurement model is a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model that identifies how many latent factors are estimated, and which items load onto which latent factor.
The structural component of a SEM model includes the regression paths that specify the hypothesized causal relations among the latent variables.
SEM is CFA, but it adds regression paths that specify hypothesized causal relations between the latent variables, which is called the structural component of the model.

# Chapter 9: Item Response Theory

Item response theory is a measurement theory and advanced modeling approach that allows estimating latent variables as the common variance from multiple items, and how the items relate to the construct (latent variable).
IRT holds promise to enable the development of briefer assessments, including short forms and adaptive assessments, that have strong reliability and validity.
In IRT, a person's construct score is estimated based on their item responses.
The construct is estimated as a latent factor that represents the common variance among all items as in structural equation modeling or confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
IRT is similar to an ordinal or categorical approach to CFA.
IRT models can estimate up to four parameters, including difficulty (severity), discrimination, guessing, and inattention/careless errors.

IRT conceptualizes reliability in a different way than classical test theory does.
In classical test theory, the same standard error of measurement applies to all construct levels.
However, IRT estimates how much measurement precision (information) or imprecision (standard error of measurement) each item, and the test as a whole, have at different construct levels.
Thus, IRT conceptualizes reliability in such a way that precision/reliability can differ at different construct levels, unlike in classical test theory.

# Chapter 10: Prediction

Human behavior is challenging to predict.
People commonly make cognitive pseudo-prediction errors, such as the confusion of inverse probabilities.
People also tend to ignore base rates when making predictions.
When the base rate of a behavior is very low or very high, you can be highly accurate in predicting the behavior by predicting from the base rate.
Thus, you cannot judge how accurate your prediction is until you know how you accurate your predictions would be by random chance.
Moreover, maximizing percent accuracy may not be the ultimate goal because different errors have different costs.
Though there are many types of accuracy, there are two broad types: discrimination and calibration—and they are orthogonal.
Discrimination accuracy is frequently evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or with sensitivity and specificity, standardized regression coefficients.
Calibration accuracy is frequently evaluated graphically and with various indices.
Sensitivity and specificity depend on the cutoff.
Therefore, the optimal cutoff depends on the purposes of the assessment and how much one weights the various costs of the different types of errors: false negatives and false positives.
It is important to evaluate both discrimination and calibration when evaluating prediction accuracy.

# Chapter 11: Clinical Judgment versus Algorithmic Prediction

Using the clinical judgment method of prediction, all gathered information is collected and formulated into a diagnosis or prediction in the clinician's mind.
The clinician selects, measures, and combines risk factors and produces risk estimate solely according to clinical experience and judgment.
In the actuarial or statistical method of prediction (i.e., statistical prediction rules), information is gathered and combined systematically in an evidence-based statistical prediction formula, and established cutoffs are used.

Clinicians tend to over-estimate exceptions to the established rules (base rate neglect).
A clinician's decision is likely to be influenced by past experiences.
Clinicians give weight to less relevant information, and often give too much weight to singular variables.
Clinicians are susceptible to representative schema biases.
Clinicians are exposed to a skewed sample of humanity, and make judgments based on a prototype from their biased experiences.
This is known as the representativeness heuristic.

In general, it is better to develop and use structured, actuarial approaches than informal approaches that rely on human or clinical judgment.
Actuarial approaches to prediction tend to be as accurate or more accurate than clinical judgment.
Nevertheless, clinical judgment tends to be much more widely used than actuarial approaches, which is a major ethical problem.

# Chapter 12: General Issues in Clinical Assessment

Many of the origins of assessment came from attempts to address wartime needs.
Since the 1980s, there has been a general decline in the frequency with which clinical assessment (and psychotherapy) are conducted by clinical psychologists, due to managed care and cost containment.
Many errors of pseudo-prediction are relevant to clinical assessment, such as confusion of inverse probabilities and regression to the mean.

Prevalence is the proportion of the population that has the condition a given point in time, whereas incidence is the rate of occurrence of new cases.
Point prevalence is the proportion of the population that has the condition at a single point in time.
Lifetime prevalence is the proportion of the population that will ever have a condition at any point in their lifetime.
The positivity rate is the proportion of tests that are positive.

Signs are observable features of a disorder.
Therefore, signs can be perceived by a clinician.
By contrast, symptoms are unobservable manifestations of a disorder that can only be perceived by the client.
A syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms that co-occur and may reflect a particular disorder.

# Chapter 13: Evidence-Based Assessment

Evidence-based assessment involves using assessment devices that are clinically relevant, culturally sensitive, and scientifically sound.
Standards are available for excellent tests.
Bayesian updating is a key technique for evidence-based assessment.
For assessing psychopathology, evidence-based techniques include dimensional and multi-stage assessment approaches.
There are many measures available for assessment; the Buros Mental Measurements Yearbook and the Handbook of Psychiatric Measures provide reviews of measures.

To conduct a multi-stage approach to assessment, start with an instrument with high sensitivity, such as tests with broad content coverage.
Low scores on a measure with high sensitivity rule out diagnosis, but high scores are ambiguous because the measure does not have high specificity.
If a person scores high on the test with high sensitivity and goes to the Yellow zone, follow up with tests that have higher specificity, including more focused tests, to reduce the number of false positives.

When publishing papers, it is important to report effect sizes, and not just statistical significance.
It is also important to report aspects of reliability and validity, both in current sample and from prior studies.
Describe the current sample and assessment methods in adequate detail.

# Chapter 14: Ethical Issues in Assessment

According to the Belmont Report, professional ethics includes respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.
It is also important to follow the APA Ethics Code and AERA guidelines.
It is also important to produce a replicable science, which requires better science, including use of measures with strong psychometrics (reliability and validity), in addition to not engaging in questionable research practices.
The open science movement, including pre-registrations, sharing data, preprints, and research materials may help improve the replicability of science.

Honor the agreement implied by the explanation provided in the informed consent.
Consider the potential social consequences of testing.
High stakes decisions probably should not be made on the basis of the results of a single test.
If you are unsure how to handle an ethical dilemma, CONSULT, CONSULT, CONSULT!
When writing assessment reports, Recognize factors, such as language, culture, and the situation, that could have impacted the results, and note them in the report.

# Chapter 15: Intellectual Assessment

Intelligence has been defined in many ways, and intelligence assessment has a long history
The assessment of intelligence is considered one of the key successes in psychology.
The most prominent contemporary theory of intelligence is the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model, which is a three-stratum hierarchical model that includes narrow abilities (stratum 1), broad abilities (stratum 2), and general abilities (stratum 3).
However, there are alternative conceptualizations of intelligence.
One alternative conceptualization of intelligence is the bifactor model.
In a bifactor model, "g" is modeled in a non-hierarchical fashion where it is extracted first, and the primary factors are extracted separately from the remaining common variance among the tests.

Assessments of intelligence have utility for various purposes, including predicting future academic achievement, characterizing functional impairment, and identifying change in functioning over time.
However, there are many things that intelligence does not predict well, such as how successfully one will perform in their job, the quality of their interpersonal relationships, or their happiness.
Moreover, there are potential weaknesses of intelligence tests, including content validity because they do not assess creativity or emotional aspects of intelligence such as empathy.

# Chapter 16: Test Bias

Bias is a systematic error.
Test bias refers to a systematic error (in measurement, prediction, etc.) as a function of group membership.
The two broad categories of test bias include predictive bias and test structure bias.
Predictive bias refers to differences between groups in the relation between the test and criterion—i.e., different intercepts and/or slopes of the regression line between the test and the criterion.
Test structure bias refers to differences in the internal test characteristics across groups, and can be evaluated with approaches such as measurement invariance and differential item function.
When detecting test bias, it is important to address it, and there are a number of ways of correcting for bias, including score adjustment and other approaches that do not involve score adjustment.
However, even if a test does not show bias does not mean that the test is fair.
Fairness is not a scientific question but rather a moral, societal, and ethical question; there are many different ways of operationalizing fairness.
Fairness is a complex question, so do the best you can and try to minimize negative impact.

# Chapter 17: The Interview and the DSM

Interviews can be administered (a) in a free-flowing way as unstructured interviews, (b) in a way that asks questions in a pre-defined way with a pre-defined order and pre-defined scoring criteria as structured interviews, or (c) as semi-structured interviews that blend structured interviews with freedom to ask follow-up questions.
In general, reliability and validity improves as the degree of structure for an interview increases.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provide the list of mental disorders and the diagnostic criteria for mental health treatment providers.
The DSM and ICD have potential strengths, including (ideally) facilitating communication, guiding treatment selection, providing justification for payment for services, providing a normalizing and empowering effect for some clients, and promoting research in psychopathology.
However, there are key concerns of the DSM and ICD, including concerns with stigmatization, pathologizing normality, poor coverage, binary classification, obscuring environmental factors, no biological criteria, potential bias, and low reliability, validity, and Utility.
There are alternatives to the DSM and ICD for conceptualizing psychopathology.
Alternative structures of psychopathology include hierarchical structures such as the *p*-factor and the hierarchical taxonomy of psychopathology (HiTOP).

# Chapter 18: Objective Personality Testing

In an objective personality test, a stimulus is presented to a respondent, who makes a closed-ended response, such as True/False or Likert ratings.
An example of an objective personality test is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI).
There are three primary approaches to developing personality measures and other scales.
One is the external approach, in which items are selected based on their association with an external criterion.
A second approach is the deductive approach, in which items are deduced based on theory.
A third approach is the inductive approach, in which items are selected based on the internal association between items that are intended to assess the same construct.
Guidelines for measurement development are provided.
Nevertheless, relying on self-report and self-assessment is prone to key weaknesses including response bias, ambiguity of items, lack of insight, and satisficing.
There are ways to improve self-assessment, but it can also be helpful to supplement self-assessments with informants' ratings and with observational assessments.

# Chapter 19: Projective Personality Testing

Projective measures are measures in which an ambiguous stimulus is presented to the respondent, who is asked to make an open-ended response.
Projective measures were developed based on psychodynamic theory and the projective hypothesis that whatever a person does when exposed to an ambiguous stimulus will reveal important aspects of the person's personality.
The goal of projective measures is to discover things that do not depend on self-knowledge and the person's ability or willingness to share it.
Projective measures aim to bypass defense mechanisms so that they assess characteristics the person has and which the person is not consciously aware of.
Examples of projective measures include the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), Draw-A-Person Test, and drawing a family (Kinetic Family Drawing).
However, there are many problems with projective measures: most projective techniques do not have standardized stimuli and testing instructions, systematic algorithms for scoring responses to stimuli, or well-calibrated norms for comparing responses with those of other people.
Their scientific status is not strong in terms of utility of norms, reliability, influence of measurement error, or validity.
In addition, they can be very time consuming, and they provide very little information.

# Chapter 20: Psychophysiological and Ambulatory Assessment

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) provide the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC).
RDoC is dimensional and it works from the ground up, starting with brain–behavior relations, and linking those to clinical symptoms.
RDoC spans multiple domains—including positive and negative valience systems—and units of analysis, including genes, molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behaviors, self-reports, and paradigms.

Psychophysiological measures include electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potential (ERP), (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (f)MRI, computerized axial tomography (CAT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electrocardiography (ECG/EKG), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), eyetracking, and actigraphy.
Psychophysiological measures are not invulnerable to issues of reliability and validity.
Another consideration of psychophysiological measures is how to handle the rich data without increasing Type I errors.

Ambulatory assessment is designed to acquire minimally disruptive measures of a person engaging in normal activities in their natural environment.
Ambulatory assessment allows rich measurement including, for example, audio, pictures, video, geolocation (global positioning system [GPS]), and physical activity (accelerometer).
Ambulatory biosensors are assessment tools that measure physiological or motor activity—e.g., cardiovascular activity (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure), physical activity (e.g., actigraph and pedometer), cortisol levels, respiration, muscle tension, blood glucose, skin conductance.
Virtual reality is an emerging approach.

# Chapter 21: Computers and Adaptive Testing

Computer-administered and online assessments have the potential to be both desirable and dangerous.
They have key advantages; at the same times, they have both validity and ethical challenges.
Best practices for computer-administered and online assessments are provided.
Adaptive testing involves having the respondent complete only those items that are needed to answer an assessment question, which can save immense time without sacrificing validity (if done well).
There are many approaches to adaptive testing, including manual administration—such as skip rules, basal and ceiling criteria, and the countdown approach—and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) using item response theory (IRT).
A CAT is designed to locate a person's level on the construct with as few items as possible.
A CAT administers the items that will provide the most information based on participants' previous responses.
CAT typically results in the greatest item savings—around 50% item savings or more.

Well-designed CATs show equivalent reliability and validity to their full-scale counterparts.
By contrast, many short forms are not as accurate as their full-scale counterparts.

# Chapter 22: Behavioral Assessment

Examples of behavioral assessment include naturalistic behavioral observation, analogue (structured) observation, self-monitoring/diary, behavior ratings (e.g., informant report), and self-report.
A gold standard for naturalistic observations is to observe people in their natural context across more than one day, time, situation, and context with more than one rater to get a more robust sampling of the person's behavior.
Compared to naturalistic observation, analogue assessments tend to show greater reliability and internal validity but lower external validity.

Behavioral observations are costly due to people and time.
The cost limits the amount of observation time that is possible, which raises questions about how typical and representative the participant's behavior was during the observation period relative to their everyday life.
The limited amount of observation time raises questions about reliability and external validity, that is the generalizability of the person's behavior in the situation to their typical functioning.

A useful approach to identify the function of a given behavior is to identify patterns of sequences according to the antecedent-behavior-consequence (A-B-C) model as part of a functional behavior analysis.
Another useful approach is self-monitoring, which provides a lot of information at low cost and is therefor a component of most empirically supported treatments.

# Chapter 23: Repeated Assessments Across Time

Repeated measurement is a design feature that can provide stronger tests of causality compared to concurrent associations.
By repeatedly assessing multiple constructs, one can examine lagged associations that control for prior levels of the outcome and that simultaneously test each direction of effect.

The inference of change is strengthened to the extent that (a) the magnitude of the difference between the scores at the two time points is large, (b) the measurement error at both time points is small, (c) the measure has the same meaning and is on a comparable scale at each time point, (d) the differences across time are not likely to be due to potential confounds of change such as practice effects, cohort effects, and time-of-measurement effects.
Difference scores, though widely used, can be less reliable than each of the individual measures that compose the difference score.
Instead of using traditional difference scores to represent change, consider other approaches such as autoregressive cross-lagged models, latent change score models, or growth curve models.

There are a variety of types of research designs based on combinations of age, period, and cohort: cross-sectional, cross-sectional sequences, time-lag, longitudinal, and longitudinal sequences, such as time-sequential, cross-sequential, and cohort-sequential designs.

# Chapter 24: Assessment of Cognition

Multiple aspects of cognition can be assessed, including cognitive products, processes, and structures or organization.
The general approaches to assessing cognition include endorsement methods and production methods.
Cognitive assessments include self-report, think-aloud approaches, random thought sampling, performance-based measures, cognitive modeling, and cognitive neuroscience approaches.
Cognitive modeling attempts to decompose behavioral performance into different indices that reflect different sub-processes.
Despite the advantages of not relying on participants' recall of their thoughts, there are challenges to using cognitive science approaches to assess cognition.
One challenge related to the use of performance-based assessment of cognition is that many such tasks involve difference scores, which tend to be lower in reliability than each of the indices that compose it.
Another challenge with performance-based assessments of cognition is known as the reliability paradox that despite some robust cognitive tasks showing well-established experimental effects, many of these tasks do not produce reliable individual differences due to low between-subject variability.

# Chapter 25: Cultural and Individual Diversity

Diverse samples provide stronger tests of theories and better generalizability of findings (external validity).
The field needs measures that are reliable and valid for all people who are assessed with them.

Diversity refers to all aspects of differences between people.
Equity refers to fair and just practices and policies that ensure everyone can thrive.
Inclusion refers to providing a community where all members are and feel respected, have a sense of belonging, and are able to participate and achieve their potential.

There are various multicultural frameworks to assessment.
Guidelines for assessment of diverse populations are discussed.
Recommendations include developing and using appropriate and valid measures for the target population(s), ensuring fair group comparisons, seeking training and consultation, developing awareness of cultural differences, showing cultural humility, avoiding assuming or stereotyping, ensuring adequate representationof under-represented minorities, considering pathoplasticity of constructs, formulating a culturally informed case conceptualization, using appropriate normative data, contextualizing group-related differences, and using inclusive language.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

This book is about the *principles* of psychological assessment to help researchers and clinicians better develop, evaluate, administer, score, integrate, and interpret psychological assessments.
The assessments one uses should be supported by science.
I provide analysis scripts in the free software, `R`.
Many `R` functions in this book are available from the `petersenlab` package.

Assessment is the gathering of information to improve decision making.
Many assessment approaches can be used to assess people's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, including self-report questionnaires, questionnaires reported by others, interviews, observations, biopsychological assessments, performance-based assessments, archival approaches, and combinations of these.
However, there has been a proliferation of pseudoscience in assessment, including harmful and inaccurate assessments, an ethical problem.
It is important to understand the characteristics of science that distinguish it from pseudoscience.

Many domains of science have struggled with a replication crisis—many findings fail to replicate.
Much of the current discussion in psychology surrounding the replication crisis deals with questionable research practices.
However, the field has paid insufficient attention to how lousy/noisy measures might contribute to the replication crisis.
It is crucial to use assessments with strong psychometric properties, including reliability and validity, and to develop better assessments.

# Chapter 2: Scores and Scales

It is important to consider the types of data your data are. 
There are four general data types: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
Nominal data are distinct categories.
Ordinal data are ordered categories: they have a name and an order.
Interval data are ordered and have meaningful distances (i.e., equal spacing between intervals).
Ratio data are ordered, have meaningful distances, and have a true (absolute) zero that represents absence of the construct.
The types of data restrict what options are available to analyze the data.
Many analyses approaches assume data that are interval or ratio.

It is also important to consider whether the data were transformed because score transformations are not neutral—they can impact the results.
Norm-referenced scores, such as percentile ranks, standardized scores, *T* scores, *z* scores, scaled scores, standard scores, scaled scores, and stanine scores are scores that are referenced to some norm or standard of comparison.

# Clinical Judgment vs. Algorithmic Prediction {#actuarial}

## Approaches to Prediction

### Human/Clinical Judgment

Using the clinical judgment method of prediction, all gathered information is collected and formulated into a diagnosis or prediction in the clinicianâ€™s mind. The clinician selects, measures, and combines risk factors and produces risk estimate solely according to clinical experience and judgment

### Actuarial/Statistical Method

In the actuarial or statistical method of prediction, information is gathered and combined systematically in an evidence-based statistical prediction formula, and established cutoffs are used. The method is based on equations and data, so both are needed.

An example of a statistical method of prediction is the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide [**CITATION**]. The Violence Risk Appraisal Guide is used in an attempt to predict violence and is used for parole decisions. For instance, the equation might be something like:

$$
\text{Violence risk} = \beta \cdot \text{conduct disorder} + \beta \cdot \text{substance use} + \beta \cdot \text{suspended from school} + \beta \cdot \text{childhood aggression} + ...
$$

Then, based on their score and the established cutoffs, a person is given a "low risk," "medium risk," or "high risk" designation.

### Combining Human Judgment and Statistical Algorithms

There are numerous ways in which humans and statistical algorithms could be involved.

[On one extreme... On the other extreme... In the middle...]

Qualitative information can be scored or coded to be quantified so that it can be included in statistical formulas.

"garbage in, garbage out"

The challenge is what to do when the human and the algorithm disagree. Hypothetically, humans reviewing and adjusting the results from the statistical algorithm could lead to more accurate predictions. However, human input also could lead to the possibility or exacerbation of biased predictions.

## Errors in Clinical Judgment

Clinical judgment is naturally subject to errors. Here are a few:

@Meehl1957 acknowledged that there may be some situations where it is glaringly obvious that the statistical formula would be incorrect because it fails to account for an important factor. He called these special cases "broken leg" cases. The example goes like this:

> "If a sociologist were predicting whether Professor X would go to the movies on a certain night, he might have an equation involving age, academic specialty, and introversion score. The equation might yield a probability of .90 that Professor X goes to the movie tonight. But if the family doctor announced that Professor X had just broken his leg, no sensible sociologist would stick with the equation. Why didn't the factor of 'broken leg' appear in the formula? Because broken legs are very rare, and in the sociologist's entire sample of 500 criterion cases plus 250 cross-validating cases, he did not come upon a single instance of it. He uses the broken leg datum confidently, because 'broken leg' is a subclass of a larger class we may crudely denote as 'relatively immobilizing illness or injury,' and movie-attending is a subclass of a larger class of "actions requiring moderate mobility." [@Meehl1957]

However, people too often think that cases where they disagree with the statistical algorithm are broken leg cases. People too often change the result of the statistical algorithm and are more likely to be wrong than right in doing so.

## Humans versus Computers

### Advantages of Computers

Here are some advantages of computers over humans:

- Computers can process lots of information simultaneously. So can humans. But computers can to an even greater degree.
- Computers are faster at making calculations.
- Computations by computers are error free (as long as the computations are programmed correctly)
- Computers' judgments will not be biased by fatigue or emotional responses.
- Computers' judgments will tend not to be biased in the way that humans' cognitive biases are, such as with anchoring bias, representativeness bias, confirmation bias, or recency bias. Computers are less likely to be over-confident in their judgments.
- Computers can more accurately weight the set of predictors based on large data sets. Humans tend to give too much weight to singular predictors.

### Advantages of Humans

Computers are bad at some things too. There may be situations in which a clinical judgment would do better than an actuarial judgment. Here are some advantages of humans over computers (as of now):

- Humans can be better at identifying patterns in data (but also can mistakenly identify patterns where there are none)
- Humans can be flexible and take a different approach if a given approach is not working
- Humans are better at tasks requiring creativity and imagination, such as developing theories that explain phenomena
- Humans have the ability to reason, which is especially important when dealing with complex, abstract, or open-ended problems, or problems that have not been faced before (or for which we have insufficient data).
- Humans are better able to learn
- Humans are better at holistic, gestalt processing; this includes facial and linguistic processing
- [complex theories]

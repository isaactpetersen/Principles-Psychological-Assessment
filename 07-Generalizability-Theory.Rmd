# Generalizability Theory {#gTheory}

Up to this point, we have discussed [reliability](#reliability) from the perspective of CTT.\index{reliability}\index{classical test theory}
However, as we discussed, CTT makes several assumptions that are unrealistic.\index{classical test theory}
For example, CTT assumes that all error is [random](#randomError).\index{classical test theory}\index{measurement error!random error}
In CTT, there is an assumption that there exists a true score that is an accurate measure of the trait under a *specific* set of conditions.\index{classical test theory}\index{true score}
There are other measurement theories that conceptualize [reliability](#reliability) differently than the way that CTT conceptualizes [reliability](#reliability).\index{classical test theory}\index{reliability}
One such measurement theory is generalizability theory [@Brennan1992], also known as G-theory and domain sampling theory.\index{generalizability theory}
G-theory is also discussed in the chapters on [reliability](#reliability) (Chapter \@ref(reliability), Section \@ref(gTheoryReliability)), [validity](#validity) (Chapter \@ref(validity), Section \@ref(gTheoryValidity)) and [structural equation modeling](#sem) (Chapter \@ref(sem), Section \@ref(generalizability-SEM)).\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}\index{validity}\index{structural equation modeling}

## Overview {#overview-gTheory}

G-theory is an alternative measurement theory to CTT that does not treat all measurement differences across time, rater, or situation as "error" but rather as a phenomenon of interest [@Wiggins1973].\index{generalizability theory}\index{classical test theory}\index{measurement error}
G-theory is a measurement theory that is used to examine the extent to which scores are consistent across a specific set of conditions.\index{generalizability theory}
In G-theory, the true score is conceived of as a person's *universe score*—the mean of all observations for a person over all conditions in the universe—this allows us to estimate and recognize the magnitude of multiple influences on test performance.\index{generalizability theory}\index{true score}\index{generalizability theory!universe score}
These multiple influences on test performance are called *facets*.\index{generalizability theory!facet}

### The Universe of Generalizability {#universeGeneralizability}

Instead of conceiving of all variability in a person's scores as error, G-theory argues that we should describe the details of the particular test situation (universe) that lead to a specific test score.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}
The universe is described in terms of its facets:\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{generalizability theory!facet}

- settings\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
- observers (e.g., amount of training they had)\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
- instruments (e.g., number of items in test)\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
- occasions (time points)\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
- attributes (i.e., what we are assessing; the purpose of test administration)\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{generalizability theory!facet}

Measures with strong [reliability](#reliability) show a high ratio of variance as a function of the person relative to the variance as a function of other facets or factors.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}
To the extent that variance in scores is attributable to different settings, observers, instruments, occasions, attributes, or other facets, the [reliability](#reliability) of the measure is weakened.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}

### Universe Score {#universeScore}

A person's universe score is the average of a person's scores across all conditions in the universe.\index{generalizability theory}\index{true score}\index{generalizability theory!universe score}
According to G-theory, given the exact same conditions of all the facets in the universe, the exact same test score should be obtained.\index{generalizability theory}\index{true score}\index{generalizability theory!universe score}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
This is the universe score, which is analogous to the true score in CTT.\index{generalizability theory}\index{true score}\index{generalizability theory!universe score}

### G-Theory Perspective on Reliability {#reliability-gTheory}

G-theory asserts that the [reliability](#reliability) of a test does not reside within the test itself; a test's [reliability](#reliability) depends on the circumstances under which it is developed, administered, and interpreted.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}
A person's test scores vary from testing to testing because of (many) variables in the testing situation.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
By assessing a person in multiple facets of the universe, this allows us to estimate and recognize the magnitude of multiple sources of [measurement error](#measurementError).\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{measurement error}
Such [measurement error](#measurementError) includes:\index{measurement error}

- day-to-day variation in performance (stability of the construct, [test–retest reliability](#testRetest-reliability))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{measurement error}\index{reliability!test–retest}
- variance in the item sampling (coefficient of [internal consistency](#internalConsistency-reliability))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{measurement error}\index{reliability!internal consistency}
- variance due to both day-to-day and item sampling (coefficient of equivalence from [parallel-forms reliability](#parallelForms-reliability), or [convergent validity](#convergentValidity), as discussed in Section \@ref(gTheoryValidity))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{measurement error}\index{reliability!parallel forms}\index{validity!convergent}

In G-theory, all sources of [measurement error](#measurementError) (facets) are considered simultaneously—something CTT cannot achieve [@Shavelson1989].\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{measurement error}\index{measurement error}
This occurs through specifying many different variance facets in the estimation of the true score, rather than just one source of error variance as in CTT.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{measurement error}\index{true score}\index{classical test theory}
This specification allows us to take into consideration variance due to occasion effects, item effects, and occasion $\times$ item effects (i.e., main effects of the facets in addition to their interaction), as in Table \@ref(tab:gTheoryTable).\index{generalizability theory}\index{measurement error}\index{measurement error}\index{generalizability theory!facet}

```{r, include = FALSE}
gTheoryTable <- data.frame("source" = c("Person (p)", "Item (i)", "Occasion (o)", "p x i", "p x o", "i x o", "p x i x o", "residual"),
                           "percentVariance" = c(30, 5, 3, 25, 5, 2, 10, 20))
```

```{r gTheoryTable, echo = FALSE}
kable(gTheoryTable,
      col.names = c("Source","Variance Accounted For (%)"),
      caption = "Percent of Variance from Different Sources in Generalizability Theory Model With Three Facets: Person, Item, and Occasion (and Their Interactions).

A score's usefulness largely depends on the extent to which it allows us to generalize accurately to behavior in a wider set of situations—i.e., a universe of generalization.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!universe}
The G-Theory equivalent of the CTT [reliability](#reliability) coefficient of a measure is the generalizability coefficient or dependability coefficient.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability coefficient}\index{generalizability theory!dependability coefficient}

### G-Theory Perspective on Validity {#validity-gTheory}

G-theory can simultaneously consider multiple aspects of [reliability](#reliability) and [validity](#validity) in the same model.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}\index{validity}
For instance, [internal consistency reliability](#internalConsistency-reliability), [test–retest reliability](#testRetest-reliability), [inter-rater reliability](#interrater-reliability), [parallel-forms reliability](#parallelForms-reliability), and [convergent validity](#convergentValidity) [in the @Campbell1959 sense of the same construct assessed by a different method] can all be incorporated into a G-theory model.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability!internal consistency}\index{reliability!test–retest}\index{reliability!parallel forms}\index{validity!convergent}

For example, a G-theory model could assess each participant across the following facets:\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}

- time: e.g., T1 and T2 ([test–retest reliability](#testRetest-reliability))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{reliability!test–retest}
- items: e.g., questions within the same instrument ([internal consistency reliability](#internalConsistency-reliability)) and questions across different instruments ([parallel-forms reliability](#parallelForms-reliability))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{reliability!internal consistency}\index{reliability!parallel forms}
- rater: e.g., self-report and other-report ([inter-rater reliability](#interrater-reliability))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{reliability!inter-rater}
- method: e.g., questionnaire and observation ([convergent validity](#convergentValidity))\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{validity!convergent}

Using such a G-theory model, we can determine the extent to which scores on a measure generalize to other conditions, measures, etc.\index{generalizability theory}
Measures with strong [convergent validity](#convergentValidity) show a high ratio of variance as a function of the person relative to the variance as a function of measurement method.\index{generalizability theory}\index{validity!convergent}
To the extent that variance in scores is attributable to different measurement methods, [convergent validity](#convergentValidity) is weakened.\index{generalizability theory}\index{validity!convergent}

An example data structure that could leverage G-theory to partition the variance in scores as a function of different facets (person, time, item, rater, method) and their interactions is in Table \@ref(tab:gtheoryDataStructure).\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}

In sum, G-theory can be a useful way of estimating the degree of [reliability](#reliability) and [validity](#validity) of a measure's scores in the same model.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}\index{validity}

### Generalizability Study {#generalizabilityStudy}

In G-theory, the goal is to conduct a *generalizability study*.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}
A generalizability study examines how generalizable scores from a particular test are if the test is administered in different situations.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}
The researcher must specify and define the universe (set of conditions) to which they would like to generalize their observations and in which they would like to study the [reliability](#reliability) of the measure.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}\index{generalizability theory!universe}\index{reliability}
For instance, it might involve randomly sampling from within that universe (in terms of people, items, observers, conditions, etc.).\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}\index{generalizability theory!universe}
In G-theory, [reliability](#reliability) is estimated with the *generalizability coefficient*.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability coefficient}\index{reliability}

### Decision Study {#decisionStudy}

### Analysis Approach {#analysis-gTheory}

Traditionally, a generalizability theory approach would test the generalizability study and decision study using a factorial analysis of variance [ANOVA; @Brennan1992], as exemplified in Section \@ref(gTheoryANOVA), (as opposed to simple ANOVA in CTT).\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}\index{generalizability theory!decision study}\index{ANOVA}\index{classical test theory}
However, ANOVA is limiting—it works best with balanced designs, such as with the same sample size in each condition condition/facet; but in most real-world applications, things are not actually balanced.\index{generalizability theory}\index{ANOVA}
So, it is better to fit G-theory models in a mixed model framework, as exemplified in Section \@ref(gTheoryMixedModel).\index{generalizability theory}\index{mixed model}

### Practical Challenges {#challenges-gTheory}

G-theory is strong theoretically, but it has not been widely implemented.\index{generalizability theory}
G-theory can be challenging because the researcher must specify, define, and assess the universe to which they would like to generalize their observations and to understand the [reliability](#reliability) of the measure.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}

### Prepare Data {#prepareData-gTheory}

#### Generate Data {#generateData-gTheory}

\index{simulate data}

```{r}
set.seed(52242)

Person <- as.factor(rep(1:6, each = 8))
Occasion <- Rater <- as.factor(rep(1:2, each = 4, times = 6))
Item <- as.factor(rep(1:4, times = 12))
Score <- c(
  9,9,7,4,9,8,5,5,9,8,4,6,
  6,5,3,3,8,8,6,2,8,7,3,2,
  9,8,6,3,9,6,6,2,10,9,8,7,
  8,8,9,7,6,4,5,1,3,2,3,2)
```

#### Add Missing Data {#addMissingData-gTheory}

Adding missing data to dataframes helps make examples more realistic to real-life data and helps you get in the habit of programming to account for missing data.

```{r}
Score[30] <- NA
```

#### Combine data into data frame {#combineData-gTheory}

```{r}
pio_cross_dat <- data.frame(Person, Item, Score, Occasion)
```

Below are examples implementing G-theory.
The `pio_cross_dat` data file for these examples come from the `gtheory` package [@R-gtheory].
The examples are adapted from @Huebner2019.

### Universe score for each person {#universeScore-example}

Universe scores for each person are generated using the following syntax and are presented in Table \@ref(tab:universeScores).\index{generalizability theory!universe score}

```{r}
universeScores <- pio_cross_dat %>%
  group_by(Person) %>%
  summarise(universeScore = mean(Score, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")
```

```{r universeScores, echo = FALSE}
universeScores %>% 
  rename("Universe Score" = universeScore) %>% 
  kable(.,
  caption = "Participants' Universe Scores.",
  format = "latex",
  booktabs = TRUE,
  linesep = "")
```

### Generalizability ($G$) Study {#gStudy-example}

Generalizability studies can be conducted in an [ANOVA](#gTheoryANOVA) or [mixed model](#gTheoryMixedModel) framework.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}
Below, I fit a generalizability study model in each framework.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}
In these models, the item, person, and their interaction appear to be the three facets that account for the most variance in scores.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
Thus, when designing future studies, it would be important to assess and evaluate these facets.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}

#### ANOVA framework {#gTheoryANOVA}

\index{generalizability theory}\index{ANOVA}

```{r}
summary(aov(
  Score ~ Person*Item*Occasion,
  data = pio_cross_dat))
```

#### Mixed model framework {#gTheoryMixedModel}

The mixed model framework for estimating generalizability is described by @Jiang2018a.\index{generalizability theory}\index{mixed model}

```{r}
summary(lmer(
  Score ~ 1 + (1|Person) + (1|Item) + (1|Occasion) + 
    (1|Person:Occasion) + (1|Person:Item) + (1|Occasion:Item),
  data = pio_cross_dat))

PxIxO <- gstudy(
  data = pio_cross_dat,
  Score ~ (1|Person) + (1|Item) + (1|Occasion) + (1|Person:Item) + 
    (1|Person:Occasion) + (1|Occasion:Item))

PxIxO
```

### Decision ($D$) Study {#dStudy-example}

The decision ($D$) study and generalizability ($G$) study, from which the generalizability and dependendability coefficients can be estimated, were analyzed using the gtheory package [@R-gtheory].\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability study}\index{generalizability theory!decision study}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability coefficient}\index{generalizability theory!dependability coefficient}

```{r}
decisionStudy <- dstudy(
  PxIxO,
  colname.objects = "Person",
  data = pio_cross_dat,
  colname.scores = "Score")
```

### Generalizability Coefficient {#generalizabilityCoefficient}

The generalizability coefficient is analogous to the [reliability](#reliability) coefficient in CTT.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability coefficient}\index{reliability}
It divides the estimated person variance component (the universe score variance) by the estimated observed-score variance (with some adjustment for the number of observations).\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability coefficient}
In other words, variance in a [reliable](#reliability) measure should mostly be due to person variance rather than variance as a function of items, occasion, raters, methods, or other factors.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!facet}\index{reliability}
The generalizability coefficient uses relative error variance, so it is relevant when decisions are made based on relative ([norm-referenced](#norm)) scores (e.g., [percentiles](#percentileRanks)).\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!generalizability coefficient}\index{norm-referenced}\index{generalizability theory}\index{data!percentile rank}

```{r}
decisionStudy$generalizability
```

### Dependability Coefficient {#dependabilityCoefficient}

The dependability coefficient is analogous to the [reliability](#reliability) coefficient in CTT.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!dependability coefficient}\index{reliability}\index{classical test theory}
It uses absolute error variance, so it is relevant when decisions are made based on absolute (e.g., [raw](#rawScores)) scores.\index{generalizability theory}\index{generalizability theory!dependability coefficient}\index{reliability}

```{r}
decisionStudy$dependability
```

## Conclusion {#conclusion-gTheory}

G-theory provides an important reminder that [reliability](#reliability) is not one thing.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}
You cannot just say that a test "is reliable"; it is important to specify the facets across which the [reliability](#reliability) and [validity](#validity) of a measure has been established (e.g., times, raters, items, groups, instruments).\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}\index{validity}\index{generalizability theory!facet}
Generalizability theory can be a useful way of estimating multiple aspects of [reliability](#reliability) and [validity](#validity) of measures in the same model.\index{generalizability theory}\index{reliability}\index{validity}

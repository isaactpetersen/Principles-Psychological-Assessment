# Reproducibility {#reproducibility}

It is important for work to be reproducible by others.
Reproducibility and replicability are key goals of the open science movement [@Gandrud2020; @OSC2015; @Tackett2019; @Tackett2019a].
To that aim, I provide information below on my setup that was used to generate the results found in this book.
If you run (all of) my code in the same order with the exact same setup, you should get the same resultsâ€”but let me know if not!

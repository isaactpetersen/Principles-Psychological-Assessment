This book would not be possible without the help of others.
Much of the content of this book was inspired by Richard Viken's course in psychological assessment that I took as a graduate student.
I thank W. Joel Schneider who provided several examples that were adapted for this book.
I thank Danielle Szabreath for help in copyediting.
I acknowledge my wife, [Alyssa Varner](https://alyssajovarner.com), who helped design several of the graphics used in this book, in addition to all of her support throughout the process.

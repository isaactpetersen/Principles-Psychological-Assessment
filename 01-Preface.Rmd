# Preface {-}

This is a book in progressâ€”it is incomplete. I will continue to add to and update it as I am able. If you have data or analysis examples that are you willing to share and include in the book, feel free to contact me.

## Acknowledgments

This book was supported by an OpenHawks Open Educational Resources grants program from the University of Iowa Libraries.

This book would not be possible without the help of others. Much of the content of this book was inspired by Richard Viken's course in psychological assessment that I took as a graduate student. I also thank W. Joel Schneider who provided some of the data and examples that were adapted for this book. I also acknowledge my wife, Alyssa Varner, who helped design several of the graphics used in this book, in addition to all of her support throughout the process.
